        # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user 
        # permission to do.
        # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
        # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
        #
        # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on. 
        # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
        # class of the resource.
        #
        # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
        # objects.
        # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
        #
        #   can :update, Article, :published => true
        #

        #Example of def initialize(user) method
        # user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)
        # if user.role? :super_admin
        #   can :manage, :all
        # elsif user.role? :product_admin
        #   can :manage, [Product, Asset, Issue]
        # elsif user.role? :product_team
        #   can :read, [Product, Asset]
        #   # manage products, assets he owns
        #   can :manage, Product do |product|
        #     product.try(:owner) == user
        #   end
        #   can :manage, Asset do |asset|
        #     asset.assetable.try(:owner) == user
        #   end
